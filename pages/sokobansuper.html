            <h2>The Sprites</h2><br>
            The game uses many sprites, despite looking so simple. 
            The player is comprised of 4 sub-sprites for each direction. 
            This allows the player to look more dynamic when moving. 
            The boxes turn into walls when pushed for convinience,
            because I didn't bother with making the boxes solid when in the hole. <br><br>

            The game will keep 2 extra sprite holders: PlayerDirection and the PreviousDirection.
            This lets me replace the player with a new sprite facing in the desired direction.
            As for level design, most levels are easy but feel free to create some of your own!
            Level 10 was a fun one because it took barely much time to make but a long time to playtest. <br><br>
            I am also working on a teleporter which can transport boxes and even the player to new places on the map, although the screen is to small to work on any larger maps.
